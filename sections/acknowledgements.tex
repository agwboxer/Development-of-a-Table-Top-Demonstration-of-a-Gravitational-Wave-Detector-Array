I am deeply grateful to everyone at the Physics Department for making my time at Royal Holloway so enjoyable. My sincere thanks to my supervisor, Gregory Ashton, for his patience, guidance, and unwavering support over the past three years. To Mattia Emma, thank you for putting up with my nonsense and helping me make this project a reality.

To my incredible friends at Royal Holloway, especially my Carfax housemates, thank you for making university life unforgettable.

To my lifelong friends from Harvey Grammar, Luca, Louis, Rakchit, Dan, Chester, Sam, Bill, and Freyja, thank you for all the memories and for being an incredible bunch of people.

To my family Jane my mum, Andy my dad, Millie, and Josie your love and support have been invaluable at every step.

To my beloved Emily, I sincerely thank you, and I say it with more depth and heartfelt intention than I have ever had with these words before. With you by my side for the last six years I have felt invincible at times and when I've been at my worst you were there to keep me going. You have been my source of motivation throughout this degree and I can't wait for our future together. I love you, always.
