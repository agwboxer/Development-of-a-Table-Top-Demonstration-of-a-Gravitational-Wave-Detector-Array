\section{Polling Rate Explanation}
\label{app:B}

It was mentioned in Section \ref{sec:3.1} that a report frequency of a desirable sensor would be 20 times per second. We determined it to be 20 times per second roughly due to the dimensions of the container and wave speed propagation. The dimensions of the container are measured to be $71.6 cm \space \times \space 43.3 cm  \space (\pm 0.1cm)$ with a wave speed of $82.4cm/s \space \pm 1.2cm/s$. The maximum possible distance from the source to a detector is  (from one corner to the opposite corner) $83.7cm$ therefore the time taken for the wave to travel this distance is $1.01s$. The reasoning behind having the polling rate at 20 times per second is that if the wave can travel across the entirety of the container in a second then it would be too fast to distinctly measure the level of the water when a wave passes through it.
