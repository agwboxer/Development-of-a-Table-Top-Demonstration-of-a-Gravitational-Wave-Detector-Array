## Week 1
**Date:** 23-29/01/2025
**Goals for the Week:**  
- [ ] Create timing model and work on triangulation problem  
- [ ] Work out how the sensor will be read by the computer
- [ ] Train the model
- [ ] Find a better solution for the wave detector
- [ ] Work out structure of report

**Progress & Notes:** 

Summary of work: 

- Timing model is still WIP - cont. for next week. Decided to use YOLOv8 which is able to identify objects and determine properties of moving object in real time. Model to be trained once wave detector is worked on. Report going along fine cont. for next week.
  
Challenges: 

- Timing model needs refinements, maths is a bit off. Wave detector needs to be improved, movement barely noticable.
  
Learnings:

- Need more ram to train model sicne each time I've done it so far it has blue screened (-_-). Bobs need to be lighter and shape to be recognisable to computer. 

**Next Steps:**  

- Continue on timing model and YOLOv8 code. Report structure needs to be done soon and start writing first few chapters. Create bobs ready to be 3D printed.
